# Bond-Pricer

This project aims to provide a platform for users to visualize the cash flow of fixed income assets, and evaluate potential interest rate arbitrage opportunities. Cash-flow is shown, with the option to evaluate compared to a loan used to buy the asset. Data is scraped from bondsupermart.com, processed with PostgreSQL, and visualized with plotly and streamlit.
